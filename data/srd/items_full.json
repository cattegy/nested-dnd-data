When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\n\nAs the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\n\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\n\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\n\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word.

You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.\n\nCall Dragons: While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call.

It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish when used in combat.\n\nPersonality: Whelm's purpose is to slaughter giants and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy goblins and giants or to protect dwarves. Whelm has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything to protect those dwarves from harm. The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His will was strong enough that he bent Whelm to his evil purposes, even killing members of his own clan.\n\n","data":{"Range":"20/60","Damage":"1d8","Weight":"2","Category":"Items","Item Type":"Melee Weapon","Modifiers":"Melee Attacks +3, Melee Damage +3","Damage Type":"Bludgeoning","Secondary Damage":"1d10","attuned":true,"description":["Requires attunement by a dwarf","Whelm is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves and lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain.","You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
